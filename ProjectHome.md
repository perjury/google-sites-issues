Feature requests and enhancements to Google Sites may be filed here.
This is not an 'official' project but is one managed and run by Google Sites TCs.
It is primarily intended for the Sites TCs to use to add and track issues.

Anyone else may add issues but they may get removed without warning.
In any case, non-project members should discuss their issue first in the Sites help forum before raising an issue in this tracker.

They should then provide a link to the thread in the Sites help forum to show where they have raised and discussed their issue.

Anybody who finds this issues list is very welcome to 'star' issues so that a) we get an indication of the demand for listed issues and b) they are notified of any updates
These are two of the reasons why this list was established
